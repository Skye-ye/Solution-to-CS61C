1. At the beginning of mapLoop, you need to load the content at address s0 into t0 instead of s0 itself
2. The offset calculation is wrong. You need to multiple t0 by 4 and add it to t1
3. Did not save temperary registers on the stack before calling func
4. Wrong instruction to load the content in memory. Should use lw instead of la
5. s1 itself is the address of func, no need to load content at address s1
6. Forget to ret at the end of map function
